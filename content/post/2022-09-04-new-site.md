I'm working on a new project ([a low-cost CO2
monitor](https://github.com/karlduino/CO2monitor)), which inspired me
to create a [new website](https://karlduino.org).

My [old website](https://karlduino.wordpress.com) is now pretty old
(last post 2014-01-14), and I just don't want to touch Wordpress
anymore.

But I feel inspired to get back into it, so why not start fresh?
